                <h3>Library Management is the adaptation of the principles and techniques of
                    management to the library situation. It includes decision making and getting
                    the work done by others. The five fundamental management functions are:
                    Planning, Organizing, Staffing, Leading and Controlling.</h3>

                    <p>Management refers to series of functions for the organization and administration of various
                        activities and people
                        in the organization. Management is essential for all types of organization and libraries are no
                        exception.
                        Libraries had very limited financial resources and limited services. Now libraries exist in
                        great
                        variety. These
                        vary in size, goals, structural pattern, financial resources, staff and many other
                        characteristics.
                        From
                        management point of view, these very in management style, morale of the staff, environment for
                        innovation, etc.
                        Now a variety of information and communication technologies are available as means to improve
                        library services
                        and operations.Library management textbooks in the United States primarily discuss the purpose
                        of
                        library
                        management, its principles, history, management theories, and organisations. A notable
                        characteristic of library
                        management theories is that they primarily used management theories meant for commercial
                        organisations to
                        describe themselves. It can be observed that the management theories developed for business
                        organisations and
                        the management theories developed for libraries make up the majority, and the largest percentage
                        are
                        those aimed
                        at business organisations </p>

                        One can see that citations of management theories meant for commercial organisations increased
                        greatly between
                        the first edition (1977) and the fifth edition (1998). Management theories developed for
                        libraries
                        were also
                        cited increasingly between the first edition (1977) and the sixth edition (2002). Though both
                        the
                        theories meant
                        for commercial organisations and those meant for the libraries have been cited less in the
                        seventh
                        edition
                        (2007) of the library management textbook, this is due to a change in the editorial policy.

                        Management theories intended for non-profit organisations were cited much less often than other
                        management
                        theories. By comparing the rate at which they are being cited, we can see that between the first
                        edition (1977)
                        and the fourth edition (1993), there has been an increase in the rate of citations for
                        management
                        theories
                        concerning commercial organisations. Since the fifth edition (1998), there has also been a
                        decline
                        in the number
                        of citations of management theories meant for commercial organisations. However, this does not
                        change the fact
                        that the overall trend has been that management theories designed for commercial organisations
                        have
                        been cited
                        with greater frequency than the others

                    <h2><u>Two Different Types of Books</u></h2>
                    <p>All books are classified as either fiction or nonfiction. Within these two types of books, you’ll
                        find dozens of more specific types, or genres.</p>

                    <h2><u>Nonfiction Books</u></h2>
                    <p>Nonfiction books contain factual information, such as biographies and history books.</p>

                    <h2><u>Examples of nonfiction books include:</u></h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Most biographies are nonfiction. We say "most" biographies, because a biography of a
                            fictional
                            character is really a fictional book.</li>
                        <li>The Diary of Anne Frank is nonfiction and a journal, making it a nonfiction journal.</li>
                        <li>Most Dictionaries and encyclopedias are nonfiction because they contain facts about words.
                        </li>
                        <li>Travel books such as an atlas are nonfiction.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>“How to” books that teach real skills, like the classic Betty Crocker Cookbook are considered
                        factual.</h4>
                    <h2><u>Fiction Books</u></h2>
                    <p>Fiction books contain a story that the author made up, such as romance or children's books. The
                        most
                        commonly read works are works of fiction. Perhaps some of their elements are based on hints of
                        truth, but they have been elaborated, fabricated, and used to embellish into a new story.</p>

                    <h2><u>Some examples of classic fiction books are :</u></h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway</li>
                        <li>To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee</li>
                        <li>Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2><u>Popular Nonfiction Book Genres Explained</u></h2>
                    <p>Adult and children’s nonfiction genres are more popular than you might imagine. These are five of
                        the
                        most popular nonfiction genres according to book sales.</p>

                    <h2><u>Food</u></h2>
                    <p>Nonfiction food books include cookbooks, but more modern food books encompass everything from
                        specific cooking elements and ingredients to specialized diets. You’ll find classic cookbooks
                        with
                        recipes and books that are part memoir/autobiography and part cookbook. Mastering the Art of
                        French
                        Cooking by Julia Child is an example of a popular food book.</p>

                    <h2><u>History</u></h2>
                    <p>Nonfiction history books include any books that lay out the known facts about a particular, time,
                        culture, or event in history. Killing England by Bill O’Reilly and Martin Dugard is an example
                        of a
                        popular history book.</p>

                    <h2><u>Memoir</u></h2>
                    <p>Memoirs are one type of autobiography. In this type of book, the author puts emphasis on specific
                        moments or events that brought about specific life lessons. A popular example of a memoir is
                        Becoming by Michelle Obama.</p>

                    <h2><u>Politics</u></h2>
                    <p>Political nonfiction books can include books written by career politicians, books that explore
                        political systems, or books that discuss the politics of a certain period. A Promised Land by
                        Barack
                        Obama is an example of political nonfiction.</p>


                    <h2><u>Popular Fiction Book Genres Explained</u></h2>
                    <p>Most adult fiction is categorized as general fiction, while a large portion of children’s books
                        are
                        classified as fiction. The popularity of genres changes over time, but these genres rarely lose
                        popularity.</p>

                    <h2><u>Young Adult</u></h2>
                    <p>Young adult fiction is written for readers ages 12 to 18. They incorporate the typical reading
                        level
                        and worldview of tweens and teens in this age group. The Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins
                        is
                        an example of popular young adult fiction.</p>

                    <h2><u>Children’s Books</u></h2>
                    <p>children’s fiction is often called children’s literature or juvenile fiction. Books in this genre
                        are
                        written with readers under the age of 12 in mind. Types of children’s books include picture
                        books
                        and chapter books. Classic Dr. Seuss books like Green Eggs and Ham are examples of children’s
                        fiction.
